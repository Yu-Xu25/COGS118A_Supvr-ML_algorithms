# COGS118A_Supvr-ML_algorithms

This repository contains the necessary code and final report for the final project of COGS 118A (supervised ML algorithms) @ UCSD. 
The project consists of making an empirical comparison of SVM, KNN, and Dcision Trees methods over three different datasets of different sizes and data types. The performance of models is measured by both the accuracy and f1-score, which are commonly used in data analysis practices.
